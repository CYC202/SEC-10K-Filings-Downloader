# SEC-Filings-Downloader

## Description
A tool to retrieve filings from the SEC based on a specified identifier (tikcer, cik), form (10k, 20f, etc.), year, amendment, etc. 

I also provide basic functionality for word frequency analysis from a given dictionary, including options for removing stop words and stemming. 

The implementation has been optimized with multithreading to enhance retrieval speed. 

It can skip existing files.
